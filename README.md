A game of Blackjack with the Deck Of Cards API written in Vanilla JS
https://deckofcardsapi.com/

Start by first registering an account with a username and password.
This section is a very basic login form using webStorage, as the main focus was the blackjack game itself with the API usage.

After logging in you will already have credits.
To start playing:

1. Start by raising or lowering the bet with the side up and down arrows.
2. Cards will be dealt for you and the dealer, after which you can choose to HIT, STAND, DOUBLE DOWN or SPLIT of the first 2 cards are the same.
3. As per the rules ( can be found here https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack ) based on your score you will either lose or double your bet

You also have settings in the top right corner to change the table color, enable or disable click sounds and also check your own statistics!

Good luck and hope you enjoy my little project!
